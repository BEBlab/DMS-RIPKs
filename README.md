# Systematic mutational mapping reveals optimal amyloid formation for RIPK function

Pipeline to replicate the analysis and figures in: 

System requirements
Software and packages to run the pipeline :
- R v3.6.3 (tidyverse, reshape2, readxl, ggpubr, ggrepel, ggsignif, ggbreak, seqinr, GGally, viridis, shadowtext)
- DiMSum (https://github.com/lehner-lab/DiMSum; Faure, A.J., Schmiedel, J.M., Baeza-Centurion, P., Lehner B. DiMSum: an error model and pipeline for analyzing deep mutational scanning data and diagnosing common experimental pathologies. Genome Biol 21, 207 (2020))

Installation: No installation required

Demo and Instructions for use: Raw sequencing data and the processed data table required for running the pipeline are deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) as part of the study PRJEB107723. Scripts and datasets needed are located in each folder and properly commented.
